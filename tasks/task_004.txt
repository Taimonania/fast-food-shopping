# Task ID: 4
# Title: Restrict Unauthenticated Access
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure that only authenticated users can access certain resources.
# Details:
Implement middleware to restrict access to all routes except `/login` and `/register` for unauthenticated users. Use session tokens to verify authentication status. The project template and dependencies are already set up.

# Test Strategy:
Attempt to access restricted routes without authentication and verify redirection to login page. Confirm access is granted upon successful login.
