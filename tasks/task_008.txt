# Task ID: 8
# Title: Optimize Performance and Reliability
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure the application meets performance and reliability standards.
# Details:
Optimize initial page load to ≤2 s on 3G connections using Next Image and code-splitting. Ensure Convex queries respond within ≤150 ms p95. Support up to 1000 concurrent users with server response <1 s p95. The project template and dependencies are already set up.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct performance testing under different network conditions and user loads to verify compliance with performance requirements.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Optimize Page Load [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Improve the page load speed by optimizing assets and reducing load times.
### Details:
Analyze current page load times, identify bottlenecks, and implement strategies such as minifying CSS/JS, optimizing images, and leveraging browser caching.

## 2. Improve Query Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enhance the performance of database queries to reduce response times.
### Details:
Before starting, check the official Convex documentation using Context7 to ensure you are following the latest best practices and API usage. Review and optimize database queries by indexing, query rewriting, and analyzing execution plans to ensure efficient data retrieval.

## 3. Conduct Load Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Perform load testing to evaluate system performance under high traffic conditions.
### Details:
Set up a load testing environment, simulate various traffic scenarios, and analyze the system's performance to identify potential bottlenecks.

## 4. Analyze Load Testing Results [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Analyze the results from load testing to identify areas for improvement.
### Details:
Review load testing data to pinpoint performance issues and provide recommendations for further optimization.

## 5. Implement Performance Improvements [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Apply the necessary changes based on load testing analysis to enhance system performance.
### Details:
Implement recommended changes from the load testing analysis, such as code optimizations, infrastructure scaling, or configuration adjustments.
